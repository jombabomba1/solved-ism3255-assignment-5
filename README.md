Similar to last assignment, in this assignment, you will create two classes: A MainClass and a second class which is used in the main class.

<ul>

 <li>Choose any entity/concept that can be modeled as class and object (except “course” and “car” which we have already modeled), and define a class for it (hereafter referred to as YourClass).</li>

</ul>

YouClass should have:

<ol>

 <li>One meaningful integer attribute and one meaningful string attribute that can be read and written. (e.g. attributes “year” and “color” for class/object “car”)</li>

</ol>

Hint1: The attributes should be <strong>private</strong>

Hint2: use get and set for each attribute (in a <strong>public property</strong>)

<ol start="2">

 <li>A method SetAttributes() that takes two parameters for and initializes the two attributes to those parameters (do not use constructors)</li>

</ol>

Hint: use the convention for naming the parameters as “<strong>inAttribute</strong>”

<ol start="3">

 <li>A method <u>PrintInfo</u> () which will print out the two attributes of any object of your class</li>

</ol>

Hint: use Console.WriteLine(….) syntax inside your method

Once you have designed YourClass, write a MainClass with a main method. Your main method should:

<ol>

 <li>Instantiate 2 objects of YourClass (hereafter referred to as obj<u>1</u> and obj<u>2)</u> and initialize them with inputs from the user.</li>

</ol>

Hint1: user Console.Readline() for input from user

Hint2: use your SetAttributes to initialize your attributes

Hint: Do not forget to compile and debug your code at this point. Your code should compile and run without any error so far.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Compare the integer attributes of the two objects and identify the object (objX, where X is 1 or 2) with the larger integer attribute.</li>

 <li>Print this object’s attributes using the <u>PrintInfo()</u> method you created</li>

</ol>

Hint: Use objX.PrintInfo() syntax in your main class
